# Sales Performance Analysis by Territory

I am actively undergoing a training with an incubator hub with Ladies In Tech Africa. This experience has been so impactful in sharpening my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. However hands-on exprience projects have helped me to gain deeper insights into data-driven decision-making processes, enhancing my abilities to extract meaningful patterns.

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to analyze and document sales performance across different territories for a retail store using Excel. This analysis will provide insights into sales trends, top-performing products, regional sales differences, and monthly sales patterns. The objective is to empower the business team with actionable insights to improve decision-making and optimize sales strategies by region.

This project is for examining sales data, the analysis seeks to uncover key insights regarding top-selling products, regional performance, customer trends, and monthly sales patterns

1. ### Goals 

- Identify the top-performing territories

- Detect underperforming areas that require more attention

- Compare quarterly or annual sales performance across regions

- Support data-driven decision-making for resource allocation and sales strategy development

### 1.1 Data Overview

Source: Sales data was gathered from the company’s CRM system and exported into Excel as CSV files.

Data Structure: The dataset includes columns for:

- Region:Geographical area where the sale was made
- Market:The specific market within a region
- Store:The name or identifier for the individual store where the sale was made.
- Trade Date:The actual date on which the sale occurred.
- Fiscal period:A standardized period for reporting sales data
- Model:Refers to the specific model of the product sold
- Line of business:The specific area or division of business under which the product sale falls
- Date category:A broader categorization of dates
- Revenue:Total revenue generated from each sale transaction.
- units sold:The total quantity of units sold in each transaction.

#### 1.2 Data Example

 #### 1.3 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Duplicates were removed from the dataset.

Missing data points for certain territories were identified and handled (e.g., using averages or filling in with previous data trends).

Dates were standardized to ensure consistency across the time period analyzed.

 ### 2 Data Analysis
---
#### 2.1  Used pivot tables to summarize

Pivot Tables were used to summarize sales data by territory and calculate key metrics such as total sales, revenue, and average sales per unit.

Charts and Graphs: Sales trends were visualized using bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to highlight sales performance by region.

I have learnt the basics of data analysis with MUSHIN AHMED at the incubator hub training with the Ladies In Tech Africa(LITA).Therefore below is the the break down of what i learnt 

i. Repoting with Pivot Tables and charts 2:

I explore even more advanced techniques and tips for creating professional-grade reports that effectively communicate your data insights.I fully mastered pivot tables and charts, offering the tools and knowledge to create dynamic, interactive, and insightful reports.


## 3. Implementation


Conditional Formatting: Applied to visually distinguish high and low sales regions.

By Categorising of units sold by category of high,Low and medium

i used a conditional function of Nested Ifs to find the Transaction category column

4 ## Visualizations and Reports

A dynamic dashboard was created in Excel, showcasing total sales by territory, percentage growth, and sales targets vs actual performance. Attached screenshots show:
- Bar chart of total revenue by region
- Line chart comparing quarterly sales trends
- Pie chart representing each territory’s contribution to overall sales

Charts: Bar charts and line graphs to visualize total revenue and growth rates.



### 4 Key Insights

Top 10-Performing Stores: [Ankpa] and [Ajoakuta] generated the highest revenue, exceeding their sales targets.
Underperforming Markets: [Boki] and [Kwali] fell below their targets, with sales declining.
Sales Trends: Steady growth was observed in the North East, while sales in the North Central fluctuated, potentially due to seasonal factors.


5 ### Learning Outcomes 

-  Ability to write complex SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data from relational databases.
