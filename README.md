I am actively undergoing a training with an incubator hub with Ladies In Tech Africa. This experience has been so impactful in sharpening my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. However hands-on exprience projects have helped me to gain deeper insights into data-driven decision-making processes, enhancing my abilities to extract meaningful patterns.

### Project overview
---
Microsoft Excel is a great way to summarize key information about your project.This project overview template can serve as a dynamic tool to track and communicate key aspects of your project

1. ### Project Name:

**Sales Performance Analysis by Territory**

2. ### Project Date:
   
Start Date: [Insert Date]

Completion Date: [Insert Date]

3. ### Project Owner:

****Sharifah Raciwu** **


1.1  **Project Objectives**

The purpose of this project is to analyze sales performance across different territories to gain insights into regional trends, sales growth, and areas for improvement. This report will help the sales team and management to:

- Identify the top-performing territories

- Detect underperforming areas that require more attention

- Compare quarterly or annual sales performance across regions

- Support data-driven decision-making for resource allocation and sales strategy development

1.2 **Scope**

This report focuses on sales data across various territories, covering key performance indicators such as total revenue, number of units sold, Model, and Line of business. The report will include:

- Sales data for [Q1 2012, full year 2023]
- Comparative analysis between different territories
- Visual representation of sales trends using Excel charts
- Recommendations for optimizing sales performance in underperforming regions

2.#### **Methodology**

2.1 ### **Data Collection**

Source: Sales data was gathered from the companyâ€™s CRM system and exported into Excel as CSV files.

Data Structure: The dataset includes columns for:

- Region
- Market
- Store
- Trade Date
- Fiscal period
- Model
- Line of business
- Date category
- Revenue
- units sold

2.2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

Duplicates were removed from the dataset.

Missing data points for certain territories were identified and handled (e.g., using averages or filling in with previous data trends).

Dates were standardized to ensure consistency across the time period analyzed.

2.3 #### Data Analysis
---
Pivot Tables were used to summarize sales data by territory and calculate key metrics such as total sales, revenue, and average sales per unit.

Charts and Graphs: Sales trends were visualized using bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to highlight sales performance by region.

3.### **Implementation**

3.1 **Excel Features Used**

Pivot Tables: To organize and summarize sales data by territory.
**Formulas**:

- SUMIFS to calculate total sales for each territory.
- AVERAGEIFS to compute average order values per territory.
- IF functions to identify underperforming territories based on sales targets.
- 
Conditional Formatting: Applied to visually distinguish high and low sales regions.

Charts: Bar charts and line graphs to visualize total revenue and growth rates.

  1. Data cleaning
  2. Visualization
  3. Data Analysis
  
I have learnt the basics of data analysis with MUSHIN AHMED at the incubator hub training with the Ladies In Tech Africa(LITA).Therefore below is the the break down of what i learnt from the class 
#### - Week one
   
  i. Basis of data analysis: Involves a series of steps to examine, clean, and interpret data in order to extract useful insights.Where he did an introduction of microsoft excel and he told us to launch a work book on our system of which he said we can have many workbooks where within the workbook we have different worksheets.The facilitator went ahead to teach us about the Ribbon interfaces in excel where it has different tabs in it  
  
  ii. Excel interface and Navigation: I learnt fundamentamentals of data analysis that helped to solidify my foundations in the course.
  
  iii. Data entry in excel: I learnt the best practices and techniques for accurately and efficiently inputting data into spreadsheets. Also learnt how to create and format worksheets, enter data using various methods, and ensure data integrity. And to discover tips  on to avoid common data entry errors and maintain data consistency.
  
#### - week two

i. Excel function I:

I gained practical tips and techniques that helped me: Create and format worksheets with ease and precision,Input data accurately using multiple methods and to  Maintain data integrity and avoid common errors.

ii. Excel function II
iii. Excel function III

#### - week 3

i. Repoting with Pivot Tables and charts 2:

I explore even more advanced techniques and tips for creating professional-grade reports that effectively communicate your data insights.I fully mastered pivot tables and charts, offering the tools and knowledge to create dynamic, interactive, and insightful reports.
  
### Explainatory Data Analysis 
---
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;

- What is the Overall Sales Trend?
- Which product are Top Sellers?
- What are the products on Peak sales?

### Data Analysis
 ---
Here we show some lines of code of Excel and queries used during the analysis 

``` sql
 select * from Table1
 where condition=True
```

    
### Data Visualization 
---
Categorising of units sold by category of high,Low and medium

i used a conditional function SWITCH to find the Transaction category column

4.1** **Key Insights****

Top 10-Performing Stores: [Ankpa] and [Ajoakuta] generated the highest revenue, exceeding their sales targets.
Underperforming Markets: [Boki] and [Kwali] fell below their targets, with sales declining.
Sales Trends: Steady growth was observed in the North East, while sales in the North Central fluctuated, potentially due to seasonal factors.

4.2 **Visualizations and Reports**

A dynamic dashboard was created in Excel, showcasing total sales by territory, percentage growth, and sales targets vs actual performance. Attached screenshots show:
- Bar chart of total sales by territory
- Line chart comparing quarterly sales trends
- Pie chart representing each territoryâ€™s contribution to overall sales
